## What I Understood
### 1. Syntax
* The syntaxes of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are relatively easy for me to understand. HTML and CSS were made to be simple, which made things a lot easier, while JavaScript's familiarity due to its similarities with C++ made scripting with it a breeze. Though my code does not always work on the first run, syntax errors are not the usual culprit.
### 2. Logic
* The logic behind the scripts we were made to write and analyze was not hard for me to grasp because of how things come together in my head. I am able to visualize the outputs of functions and figure out how to make a script do different things. I like slicing problems into the conditions and iteration variations that make them up, which makes seeing patterns much easier.
### 3. Loops
* Looping is a simple concept to me. The repetition of a command with some variation to it allows for better code flexibility and efficiency, and I keep this in mind whenever I code. I prefer to use iterative loops (for loops, for instance) as they make visualization easier, but I also use conditional loops when more applicable.
### 4. Nesting
* Nesting can be confusing with how it can create so many branches of possibility in such a small and dizzying space. Despite this, I am able to focus on the important parts of the nest and discern which parts of the nested loops or conditionals affect which aspects of the output. Consequentially, I tend to nest loops and conditionals when appropriate.
### 5. Boolean Operators
* Boolean operators are familiar to me because I have always been rather interested in logic and computing. The ways that the logic gates manipulate true and false is intuitive, in my opinion. AND checks if two inputs are identical; OR checks if either or both of two conditions are fulfilled; NOT inverts a boolean output; NOR functions as an anti-NOR; XOR checks if either but not both of two conditions are fulfilled, and the like.

## What I Need to Improve On
### 1. Theoreticals
* Sometimes, handling code mentally without an editor causes me to fumble because it causes me to handle more information than I can reliably juggle.
