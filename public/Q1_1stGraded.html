      <br><br>Prayer for Loving Sorrow by Francis Jammes: <br><br>
    |     I have nothing but my sorrow and I want nothing more.
    |     It has been, it still is, faithful to me.
    |     Why should I begrudge it, since, during the hours when my soul crushed the depths of my heart, it was seated there beside me? <br>    |
    |     O sorrow, I have ended, you see, by respecting you, because I am certain you will never leave me. <br>    |
    |     Ah! I realize it: your beauty lies in the force of your being.
    |     You are like those who never left the sad fireside corner of my poor black heart. <br>    |
    |     O my sorrow, you are better than a well-beloved: because I know that on the day of my final agony, you will be there, lying in my sheets, O sorrow,
    |     so that you might once again attempt to enter my heart. <br><br>
