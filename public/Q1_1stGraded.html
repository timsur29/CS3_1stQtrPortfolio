    <br><br>Prayer for Loving Sorrow by Francis Jammes: <br><br>
    | I have nothing but my sorrow and I want nothing more. <br>
    | It has been, it still is, faithful to me. <br>
    | Why should I begrudge it, since, during the hours when my soul crushed the depths of my heart, it was seated there beside me? <br>|<br>
    | O sorrow, I have ended, you see, by respecting you, because I am certain you will never leave me. <br>|<br>
    | Ah! I realize it: your beauty lies in the force of your being.
    | You are like those who never left the sad fireside corner of my poor black heart. <br>|<br>
    | O my sorrow, you are better than a well-beloved: because I know that on the day of my final agony, you will be there, lying in my sheets, O sorrow,<br>
    | so that you might once again attempt to enter my heart. <br><br>
