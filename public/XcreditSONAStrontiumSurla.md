1. **Interesting Points**
    * Free internet connection is rather promising and could help reduce operating costs for businesses both foreign and local, as well as make educational resources more accessible. This could go hand-in-hand with the proposed improvements to power generation and distribution.
    * It is good that the government is taking initiative to take down illegal crime rings dealing in drugs, gambling, etc.
    * More freedom of information and stricter documentation and audits on government spending will be beneficial in rooting out corruption. If this will be possible and if politicians will be willing to take such action cannot yet be known.
    * The changes proposed during the session could empower government to spend money more wisely and potentially strengthen the country's businesses and overall economy. 
2. **Weird Points**
    * Despite infrastructure projects continuing, "leopard spots," concrete patches, and potholes continue to be a common feature even in major roads.
    * I understand the need for restocks and modernization to our armories as tensions and violence from the NPA, Abu Sayyaf, and other extremist organizations rise, but are our current resources not enough? Do we not need to focus also on what those arms will protect?
    * The SONA was extremely short, lasting from 15:58 to 17:18. Much more elaboration could have been given to the many issues talked about, including the specific methods by which goals such as utility cost reduction, freedom of information, and the rooting out of criminals will be done.
3. **Reflection**
    
    Listening to the 2025 SONA, I have learned a little more about the strengths and weaknesses of this country: the strengths of its initiative and resolve, but its weakness in its current state and the actions it has taken. The promises of reform made this day echo those made by this administration and those that came before, yet many of them have yet to be fulfilled. For instance, corruption continues to be a known issue, as evidenced by the low quality of infrastructure and the lack of apparently good change in its sorry state, which can be seen in the cut corners of roads (even major ones) and the thinly-spread resources of many public facilities like schools and hospitals. I admire the efforts taken to make improvements for our nation, but I fear for the possibility they may fall flat in practice.
    
    When I reflect on the Philippines, I see a ground of near-infinite possibility in the strength of its people and its great wealth of resources. The steps proposed today show promise, that they might reclaim the momentum lost to wrong turns made in the past and reforms made too late, and I sincerely wish that the hope the people have for this day's proposals will not turn out to have been misplaced. Today, seeds are planted. May this administration and those that come after cultivate them for the harvest of tomorrow.

4. **One-sentence Message**
    * May the words of this meeting age well, and may the promises made be fulfilled.

### Additional Notes:
* proposed reforms to almost every side of life, from rehabilitation efforts and infra to power and agriculture
* good that we continue to make efforts to harness technology and make our current systems technological or otherwise more efficient
* it really isn't great that our flood prevention systems are *this* ineffective given our natural vulnerability to such kind of disaster, good that our president calls attention to these flaws and calls for reform
