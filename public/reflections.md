# End of 1st Quarter Reflections by Tim Surla, 9-Strontium

## What I Understood
### 1. Syntax
* I personally found the syntaxes of HTML, JS, and CSS easy to understand, especially because C++ last year was like a more complex JS. The grammar and structuring of these languages is intentionally simple to make web design easier, which I think helped as well. My code does not always work on its first run, but syntax errors are rarely the culprit.
### 2. Logic
* Grasping the logic of code is something I have come to understand deeply. I visualize each iteration and condition branch of the function to understand how it works and what is meant to do. In doing this, I find out about different ways to solve problems and fix code.
### 3. Loops and Conditionals
* I find loops and conditionals to be somewhat intuitive. Conditionals are simple in that their sole purpose is to check if a condition has been met. Loops are more complicated in that they can be influenced by number of iterations or controlled by a conditional, but I still find them easy to visualize and break down.
### 4. Nesting
* I prefer to cut problems into slices by condition and iteration. Because of this, I find even nested code to be easy to pick apart and understand. Consequentially, I use nested loops and conditionals where appropriate and efficient.
### 5. Boolean Operations
* Boolean operations and their ability to manipulate conditions can be quite confusing, but I am familiar with them because of where my interests have led me. AND checks fif two conditions are met; OR checks for either; NOT inverts any condition; XOR checks for only one of either, and the like. Logic gates are useful for switching solutions or behaviors, catching errors, and fulfilling other important roles in code that I frequently use.

## What I Need to Improve On
### 1. Theoreticals
* I still find doing coding problems in my head difficult. The sheer amount of information I need to process sometimes overwhelms me and causes me to make mistakes. I can remedy this by using tools like pen and paper to prevent myself from getting lost and by practicing more in order to generally get better at it.
### 2. Customization
* Customization using CSS is not difficult, but I occasionally get lost navigating the different properties of an element and finding ways to make them as interesting as the HTML elements I see online. Simply reading more on it and experimenting more in my free time will help me improve by a lot. Even still, I will consult my more experienced classmates for their advice and knowledge.
### 3. Class/Object Definition
* I hardly understand how defining new elements and properties works in CSS, particularly when making stylesheets. I sometimes set out to do more than I know how to do and end up disappointed by the much more difficult reality. Again, reading and consultation will be of great help to me.
### 4. JS Integration in HTML
* I do fine in both JS and HTML, but I sometimes run into issues integrating them, especially when quotation marks and other syntax quirks get in the way of the "normal" use of either language. When functions become more complex and involve more variables (especially inputs), I start to get overwhelmed or make errors. I believe more coding task practice will be enough to help me figure out how to solve this problem. 
### 5. Debugging
* Debugging code that has already been written is a struggle for me because much of my thought process when it comes to coding revolves around being familiar with code that I build myself and understand deeply. I feel that doing more collaborative projects with my friends should give me good debugging practice. This is especially important to me because real-world coding is almost never done alone.

## Two Activities That Helped Me
### 1st Graded Activity
* The 1st Graded Activity really helped me out because it encouraged me to mess around and explore, two things that are major drivers of learning when it comes to CS. Having a little more wonder and whimsy made learning web design less of a chore and more of a fun activity for me to enjoy and share with others. I really love activities that encourage creativity and excite the mind.
### Debugging Activity
* The debugging activity, while not necessarily enjoyable, was a necessary learning experience. Reality involves a lot of collaboration with people who might not have the same coding and design philosophies as me, meaning that learning to work with others is essential if I want to survive. Though the debugging activity was relatively simple, the lessons that it imparted to me will help me with much bigger problems in the future.

## Two Activities That Did Not Help Me
* I believe all of the activities helped me to some capacity, even if I did not find all of them enjoyable. They each taught me something, like JS use with HTML, formatting, algorithm-designing, and more. I think all learning experiences are important in life, especially those that force one to leave the comfort zone and expand their horizons.
